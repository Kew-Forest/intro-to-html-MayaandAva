<p>The king was coming to visit. No one knew why he picked to visit Sara’s house, but that was his choice and no one questioned him. The king was known for his misdeeds and heart of stone, so Sara’s family was not at all pleased to have him come. They spent a week cleaning, washing and scrubbing their little apartment until it shined. They knew that the king would pick on every imperfection and even snoop around in their things, taking pictures of any potentially embarrassing items and posting them on Social Media for everyone to see. His yearly visits to random homes kept getting worse and worse. 
Finally, the day came. The king was coming. Sara, Ava, and their parents had picked out their best clothes and had set a timer to wake up at 5:00; the king hadn’t said what time he was coming and was sure to come at the most inconvenient time. Everyone was still asleep when there was a knock at the door. And then another. Boom! Boom! Boom! Everyone was still asleep. BANG! BANG! Sara’s mom awoke with a jolt. Ding- dong ding- dong BOOM! It sounded like a stampede of bulls trying to charge into their apartment. The whole family finally woke up and were sleepily rubbing their eyes. 
“What’s happening?” asked Ava, Sara’s little sister, drowsily.” “Wake up! Get out of bed! Wear you clothes!” cried their mom, trying to be heard over the pounding on the door. “Look as presentable as you can!” In a flash, they were all ready and ran to the door. Before opening it, they put on their best smiles and took a deep breath. This was going to be bad.
As their mom opened the door for the king, Sara felt a sudden urge to hide in the cabinet that was next to the cabinet for the garbage can in the kitchen “This is so ridiculous,” she said to herself, but she still went to the cabinet and hid before the king saw her. Sara kept the door of the cabinet opened a crack to see what was going on. With a bit of luck, no one would see her.
7 year old Ava was standing bravely in front of the king, lying through her teeth about how pleased they were to see him. 14- year old Sara, hiding in the cabinet, silently thanked her little sister for her outstanding bravery. Sara and Ava’s parents were standing awkwardly next to Ava. The king was standing in the doorway with all of his servants behind him. (They were all men). He had his two sons, Chris and Allan, next to him. Chris was the handsome son, and was rumored to be favored by the king. Chris was 17 and Allan was 15. No one knew much about Allan because Chris was the only one ever talked about, as he was known as the “better” son. 
“Aren’t you ever letting me in?” The king asked angrily. “You already kept me waiting at the door for so long!” “I’m very sorry,” said the children’s mom. Everyone was being so polite to this unjust man, it made Sara want to throw up!
“The king marched into the living room without even taking his shoes off and plopped on the couch. His sons and the servants waited outside of the house. “What a nice, welcoming mansion this is,” said the king sarcastically. He spat his gum out on the beautiful persian carpet and rubbed it in with his golden boot. Next, he ranted on and on about the “wonderful” arrangement of the apartment and criticized the decorations. Sara was getting so fed up! She looked at the crowd by the door. When was the king ever going to let them in?
Suddenly, the king stood up. At the same time, Allan saw Sara and he gave her a pleading look that seemed to say, “help me!” Realizing that she had opened the door of the cabinet too much, Sara quickly closed the door. Now she couldn’t see what was happening but could hear it and catch on pretty well of what was happening. 
Here’s what happened: the king strode to Allan and, by the sound of it, picked him up, covering his mouth to muffle his pleas for help. Sara heard the king’s loud footsteps dangerously nearing the cabinet that she was hiding in. She held her breath, praying that the king hadn’t figured out where she was. But instead, the king’s footsteps stopped right before Sara’s hiding place. It seemed like he stopped right in front of the cabinet with the garbage can! “What in the world is this crazy man doing?” wondered Sara incredulously. The king opened the door of the garbage can and, struggling, threw Allan inside the garbage can! Sara opened the door of her cabinet just enough to see the king take a banana peel out of the compost and stuff it into Allan’s mouth! 
“Child abuse!” interrupted Ella. “Ahem.” said Nora, rolling her eyes.
“He then slammed the door shut and stomped off towards Ava and their parents, who had been watching the king’s strange behavior with their mouths wide open in horror. “Let’s go,” said the king. “Don’t you have more of the house to show me or is this all you have?” “Yes, yes of course,” stammered Sara’s mom who had not yet recovered from the shock. “Right this way to me and Fred’s room.” (Fred was the name of the children’s dad). She then led the way, with the servants following behind her at the king’s command. When no one was looking at her direction, Sara gave her mom a thumbs- up. Her mom relaxed, knowing that Sara would at least try to help Allan.
	When everyone had gone to her parent’s room, Sara got out of the cabinet she was in, went to Allan, and helped him out of the garbage can. “Thank you,” said Allan. “What’s your name?” “I’m Sara,” she answered. “We should get out of here so that the king doesn’t see us.” “Where should we go?” asked Allan. “We can go to my secret hideout,” suggested Sara. “That will give us enough time to think of a plan.” Allan followed Sara to her room, where Sara got on her bed and took down the painting that was on the wall, revealing a doorway in the wall that was just big enough to squeeze through. Leading the way, Sara climbed into her secret hideout, with Allan following close behind. 
Sara’s hideout was a small room, lit up by colorful fairy lights strung around the walls. There was a shelf in the corner of the room holding a few odd- shaped rocks and shells. There was a clear door in the corner of the room, with a perfect view of the park. “If you open it, it will teleport you to anywhere you want, even the moon!” explained Sara enthusiastically. The whole ceiling above them was clear glass, showing them a perfect view of the bright morning sky. “This place is amazing,” said Allan with awe. They stood there for a moment, taking in the wonder.
The King’s most devoted servant watched the door of Sara’s hideout close. “She thinks she can get away with that,” he thought with a smirk. As he climbed up Sara’s bed to get to the hideout, he thought of how pleased the King would be with him for what he was about to do. “This is my chance to be favored by him,” he said to himself.
In the hideout, Sara and Allan were discussing their plan, oblivious of the servant who was about to come in the hideout. Their plan was that they would somehow lure the King into the hideout and into the clear door, so that he would fall through. Then, they would tell the door to transport the King to the moon, and the clear door’s magic would shoot the king up onto the moon, supply him with everything he needs, and after one hour, bring him back. The moon purified people and was commonly used as a tool for criminals. If you had a transporting door, just like Sara’s, you were able to sentence criminals onto the moon until their souls were purified. This is because the gasses and sand on the moon would swirl around the criminal, taking away their negativity and replacing it with peacefulness and compassion.
Sara and Allan were about to leave the hideout and carry on with their plan, when the servant came in the hideout with a sword. “Your majesty!” cried the servant, loud enough for the King to hear from Sara’s parents’ room. “I’ve got a criminal! And she’s got your son, Allan!” No one was aware that Sara was actually a part of the family and that she lived in the apartment since she had been hiding from the very beginning.
The King came running and climbed into Sara’s hideout. The servant touched his sword to Sara’s neck and made her back up into the wall of the hideout. Luckily, it was the same wall that the clear door was! This made it so much easier for Sara, who with one swift movement, opened the clear door and pushed the servant into it! “To the moon!” she yelled triumphantly. With a loud whooshing sound, the servant shot up into the air and disappeared. Everyone, even the King, stood there in amazement as the servant got smaller and smaller in the sky. By now, all the servants, Chris, Ava, and Sara’s parents were crammed into the hideout, trying to understand what all the commotion was about.
“You’ve had enough of your victory, you horrible intruder!” the King shouted. He rushed at Sara with the intention of pushing her through the clear door. However, Allan pushed his father before he could push Sara, and the King fell through the hole! “To the moon!” shouted Sara and Allan. “Hurray!” shouted everyone except for Chris (Even the servants- they were all good except for that servant who had gone to the moon). Sara and Allan high- fived and congratulated each other joyfully as they watched their King shoot up into the sky and disappear.
The King yelled something, but everyone was celebrating too loudly to hear. But what he said was, “Now what’s going to happen now that I’m gone?” 
	We know the answer to that question anyways. Apparently, the King didn’t understand the concept of the transporting door. The sentences to the moon only take about an hour to fully purify the person’s soul, so he was back very soon. When the King came back, he had changed completely. He hugged his sons and regretfully apologized to Allan. However, when everyone was leaving, Chris turned to Sara and snarled, “I’ll get you back for that. You just wait and see!”
	“He’s acting just like a boar, snarling like that,” Sara giggled. “Perhaps I should send him to the moon too!”</p>

				Once upon a time, there was a king and queen named Prince and Princess. They lived in an exquisite palace, atop towering mountains. The palace overlooked the kingdom that King Prince and Queen Princess ruled. 
I know, these were very stupid names for a king and queen. But give their parents, the namers of these two royals, a break. You must think back to when King Prince and Queen Princess were just born and their parents had to name them. (They of course had different parents and only the Queen was born royal- the king was married into royalty). At the time, the king and queen had to name their daughter (the present Queen Princess). And guess what? They chose the name Princess. Neither of them were thinking about the future, when the princess would turn into a queen. They were just thinking about the present. So, they signed all the papers for their newborn baby, officially naming her Princess. Only then did they realize their mistake. But it was too late. Their daughter was stuck with the name Princess. In those days, it was strongly forbidden to change your name once you had officially been named, so Princess was never allowed to change it. The Royal Namers of the kingdom were very strict and did not allow her to change it, even though she was royalty.
	In the meantime, the present- king was being named. His parents were ordinary people in the kingdom who owned a bakery, and, just like the ordinary people they were, they named their little baby Paul.
	As time went by, Princess became a teenager. Her mother sent her on numerous errands to the bakery that Paul’s parents owned. Paul was always there to greet her, and they became good friends. As time went on, they fell in love, got married, bought a dog named Mars, and became king and queen. Paul, out of his loyalty to Princess, begged the Royal Namers to allow him to change his name to Prince, so that Princess wouldn’t feel so bad about being the queen but her name being Princess. The Royal Namers, out of compassion, finally allowed this exception to be made. And that is how the Prince and Princess, who were actually king and queen, got to have their names.
	The king and queen decided to have a baby and were once again faced with the problem of naming the baby. Princess wanted to name her Princess, after herself. She told Prince, “Fair husband, I beseech thee to listen to the words that falleth out of my mouth.” (In those days, that was how proper people spoke to one another- it was also the time where Shakespeare was still alive). But her husband refused to listen, saying, “Oh, my fair lady, hast thou forgotten how hard were those days? Hast thou forgotten my act of heartfelt kindness to spare your soul from despairing your life away with that name? Dost thou want to pour that dreaded liquid of misery onto the soul of our innocent newborn by naming her Princess?” 
Finally, the queen convinced her husband to listen to her. She told him, “I understand thee well, my love, but now thou must listen. Thou must not forget that it was my name, that thou now call dreaded, that brought us closer as lovers. Out of kindness, thou changed thy name, and thou made me love thee more than ever. Our baby’s name can help her as well, as it helped me. What say you, husband?” “I say no. Thou art a scoundrel for wanting to name our daughter Princess!” [you must remember that the child was still not born and that they did not know the gender of the baby anyways.] “Away, you elf-skin, you dried cow’s-tongue, bull’s-pickle, you sock-fish! Come back when you no longer want to name our daughter that dreaded name!” Shocked with her husband’s foul language, the queen left the palace with her faithful companion, her dog Mars, and headed for the Local Witch’s house to ask for help. 
When the queen got to the Local Witch’s house, the witch had been practicing her spells at the door, since she had hung a picture of a man she hated on the door to practice her curses on. The distressed queen forgot all her etiquette and, instead of knocking on the door, she barged into the house. The witch had just been practicing her transformation spells (at the door, of course) when the queen came in, and the witch accidentally shot the queen with her spell! The queen started to shrink at an alarming rate, and turning a bit translucent. Once she had shrunk fully, she was no longer a human, but a walking and talking gummy bear! 
“I’m awfully sorry, your majesty,” said the shocked witch. “Can thou turn me back?” asked the tiny queen. “I’m afraid I will not be able to rule the kingdom as well if I stay a gummy bear.” “Oh fair lady, there is only one way to cure you of this horrendous fate. You must travel to Mars. See?” said the witch, pointing to her spell book. It said, “Cure: Thy gummy bear must stand on Mars and recite this chant: 
“Water, Earth, fire, and air,
Save my soul from r,
Save me from being a gummy bear.
Magic of Mars, Please hear my plea,
Please help me to be set free.”
“I’m very sorry, your majesty, but it appears that thou shall never turneth back into a human. As of now, there is no way to travel to Mars,” said the sorrowful witch. “Watch out!” shrieked the witch. The queen’s dog was trying to lick the gummy bear (the queen)! The queen jumped out of the way just in time. All of a sudden, a wonderful thought came into her mind. “I’ve just had a wonderful idea!” said the queen. “The book did not specify which mars to go on, the planet or the dog, correct?” “Very correct, lady!” said the witch. 
	So the witch picked up the gummy bear and put her on top of Mars (the dog of course). “Wait,” said the queen, “I’ve just forgotten the poem I has't to recite!” “Calm yourself, lady,” said the witch. “I shall hold the spell book in front of thee. Thank heavens Mars is a calm dog and will not move!” So the witch held the book in front of the queen and the queen recited:
“Water, Earth, fire, and air,
Save my soul from despair,
Save me from being a gummy bear.
Magic of Mars, Please hear my plea,
Please help me to be set free.”
	At once, the queen started to grow. She grew and grew and suddenly, she was no longer a gummy bear, but a human! She and the witch danced and rejoiced happily! Mars happily licked the queen’s face, relieved to have his master back. Then, the Queen and Mars headed back to the palace. The Queen had forgotten the whole reason why she had come to the witch in the first place! When she got back, she greeted her husband warmly. “Well, hast thou re-thinketh thine decision?” He asked her. Only then did the Queen finally remember. But since she had not yet made up her mind, she decided to be honest about it and tell everything to her husband. When she had finished telling her story, she said, “Now I understand, dear husband. The name Princess comes with many challenges that I would not like to bestow upon my daughter at such an early age. Thou may name our daughter.” “My fair wife, I thank thee for being so kind to me. I suggest that we shall wait until our daughter is born, and we may be inspired as to what to name her.” And that is what they did. They waited until the Queen gave birth. 
But when she gave birth, instead of a human, out came a little gummy bear! The Queen and King rushed to the Local witch’s house with their gummy bear and their dog Mars and burst through the door. Thankfully, the witch wasn’t practicing any spells at the moment, so they were all safe. When the witch saw them, she said, “Oh my! I was afraid this would befall. Thou were pregnant when thou turneth into a gummy bear, and thou only recited the rhyme for yourself. Thou said, “Please help me to be set free.” We forgot all about thy baby! But worry not. I shall fix this.” She then took out her spell book and opened it to the page that was about turning people into gummy bears. She carefully picked up the crying baby gummy bear and put him on Mars. Then she recited:
“Water, Earth, fire, and air,
Save this baby’s soul from despair,
Save this baby from being a gummy bear.
Magic of Mars, Please hear my plea,
Please help him to be set free.”
“Waiteth!” exclaimed the King. “Did thou just say ‘help him to be set free?’ Not her?” “Thee hath heard me right,” said the witch.
All at once, the gummy bear started to grow and grow. He grew until he was no longer a gummy bear, but an adorable newborn boy. The Queen lovingly picked him up from Mars’ back and cradled him. “We shall name him Gummy Bear,” announced the Queen, and the King agreed. They thanked the witch and set out to their palace. “All yond drama about naming our daughter when it wast a boy all ‘long!” chuckled the King. And they lived happily ever after!
